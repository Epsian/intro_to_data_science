## Overview

[DB Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/){rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"} is an ultra lightweight viewer for SQLite databases. It is made to allow those familiar with spreadsheets to work more easily with the common SQLite format. However, that is all that it does; you cannot use it on other database types.

## DB Browser on Windows

First head to the [DB Browser download page](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/), and select the version that matches your system. On Windows this is most likely the 64-bit standard installer.

On the next screen, accept the license agreement and press `Next`. The following page will ask you if you would like to place shortcuts anywhere. Desktop will place icons on your desktop, while Program Menu will add options to your right click menu. You can choose to have these if you wish, I will not. Press `Next` once you have decided.
