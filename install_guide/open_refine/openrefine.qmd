## Overview

[OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) is an open source tool used to clean and pre-process messy data. While most people are familiar with data cleaning in their coding tool of choice (R, Python, Julia, etc.), OpenRefine is designed to provide powerful cleaning capabilities with minimal overhead. One of the most helpful capabilities of OpenRefine is the ability to check for possible duplicates and misspellings of text data using it's text facet tools.

## OpenRefine on Windows
