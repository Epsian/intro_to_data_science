## Overview

**git** is a tool for version control and collaboration. It is *the* tool used by data science teams big and small to keep track of code. Think of it like track changes in Word or Google docs, but for code files. 

## git on Windows

First, launch a web browser, the image below shows the Microsoft Edge browser.
