I earned my Ph.D.Â at the University of California, Davis in in sociology with a designated emphasis in computational social science. I combine computational methods such as social network analysis, natural language processing, geospatial analysis, and machine learning with open source and governmental data to uncover patterns of misfeasance and malfeasance by our public servants. From the political networks of politicians and prohibition gangsters to bias hidden in the text of academic recruitment, I use new methods to work on old problems of corruption and inequality.\nAt Smith College I am a visiting assistant professor in the Statistical \u0026amp; Data Sciences program. I have experience working with both United States and United Kingdom governmental organizations applying machine learning to real-world problems. In the UK I worked with the national lab for data science and machine learning, the Alan Turing Institute, on early detection systems in foster care to assure children were receiving adequate services. Meanwhile in the US I worked with the Internal Revenue Service to built a machine learning system that determined the credibility incoming fraud reports.\nContacting Me Slack Office Hours You can send me a message on the course Slack workspace, and I will respond when I am able, typically within 24 hours during the work week. To message me, click the + button next to \u0026ldquo;Direct Messages\u0026rdquo; and search for my name. If you are asking a question about a lab or assignment, consider putting it in the #help channel instead. There is a good chance one of your classmates can answer before I can.\nYou can schedule a meeting with me on Calendly. Different times may have differing options for in-person/video call meetings.\nLecture Plans Each week will follow the same basic structure. Monday and Wednesday classes will include lectures designed to introduce new concepts. Lecture will be followed by interactive problem sets designed to reinforce those concepts through active learning.\nFriday classes will be devoted to lab activities, project work time, or exams. Students are expected to come to class to work on these activities.\nCourse Policies Required Materials Students are not expected to buy any materials for this course. Data science is built on free and open collaboration, and there is no shortage of high quality learning material available. This reader, as well as all assignments, will likewise be freely available for all into the foreseeable future.\nStudents are required to have a working computer (preferably a laptop) and reliable internet connection for this course. Any reasonably recent computer should be sufficient, with the notable exception of Chromebooks. Chromebooks lack access to the majority of the tools used by data scientists, and thus it will be difficult to complete course assignments with one.\nIf you only have access to a Chromebook, please speak with me as soon as possible.\nStudent Workload This is a 4-credit course, meaning that by federal guidelines, you should be spending about 9 hours per week on this course outside of class.\nAttendance I will not be taking attendance in this course, and you do not need to inform me when you will be absent. If you are sick, please stay home. That said, I expect students to be present when possible. It will be very difficult to keep up with course material without consistent attendance.\nIf you miss a class, you should contact a peer to discuss what was missed, and check the course reader website for any upcoming deadlines. I won\u0026rsquo;t have the capacity this semester to re-deliver missed material in office hours.\nMake rules about missing exams\nAcademic Honesty Smith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources.\nAny cases of dishonesty or plagiarism will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Examples of dishonesty or plagiarism include:\nSubmitting work completed by another student as your own. Copying and pasting words from sources without quoting and citing the author. Paraphrasing material from another source without citing the author. Failing to cite your sources correctly. Falsifying or misrepresenting information in submitted work. Paying another student or service to complete assignments for you. Student Collaboration Accommodation Smith is committed to providing support services and reasonable accommodations to all students with disabilities. To request an accommodation, please register with the Disability Services Office at the beginning of the semester.\nGrading Standards Based Grading This course will be graded using a standards-based assessment system. This means that rather than assignments being graded based on the percentage of the question you answered correctly, your responses will be compared against a pre-defined set of course standards and assigned a level of proficiency. You will have multiple opportunities over the course of the semester to showcase the depth of your understanding regarding these standards.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s consider a hypothetical assignment under a traditional and standards based grading system.\nAn important feature of mastery grading is how your understanding of a topic is totaled at the end of the semester. In traditional points style grading, an average is taken of all your assignments, and your final grade is represented by that average. This means all assignments are given equal consideration in your final grade.\nMean of\nA1-A5 In contrast, standards based grading is only interested in your understanding of the material at the end of the course. This means that only your highest level of demonstrated proficiency is tallied. Functionally this means that only your best score in each proficiency is kept; all others are effectively forgotten. This allows you to safely engage with complicated topics early on, and have opportunities to show improvement without penalization. This also means if you master a concept early on, you not need to worry about it for the remainder of the course.\nMax of\nA1-A5 A standards-based grading system carries a number of other benefits:\nLearning targets for the course are clearly defined from the outset, and every graded assignment that you receive will be directly tied to at least one standard. This should make it abundantly clear what skills and competencies I\u0026rsquo;m assessing on every single assignment. There is no \u0026ldquo;busy work\u0026rdquo; with a standards-based system.\nNo one assignment will make-or-break your grade. You have multiple opportunities to demonstrate fluency in a standard. This rewards students that take the time to practice and learn from their mistakes. It prioritizes student growth throughout the course of the semester.\nAssessments in a standards-based system are much clearer than in a point-based grading system. Saying that I\u0026rsquo;ve become proficient in data wrangling, joining, and visualizing means more than saying that I earned a 92.5 in my Introduction to Data Science course.\nA standards-based grading system makes it easier to monitor your progress towards a certain grade.\nStandards The following table lists all the standards you will be evaluated on in this course. Each standard states what conditions must be met to reach a proficiency level. There are four proficiency levels for each standard, with eac h increase in level requiring more\nAdditionally, to demonstrate full mastery in a topic you must demonstrate your aptitude during an individual examination.\nStandard Does Not Meet Standard Progressing Toward Standard Meets Standard Demonstrates Mastery Individual Mastery Debugging Functions Iteration Markdown Authors Markdown documents that do not compile. Authors Markdown documents that compile but either do not include necessary content or include unnecessary content. Authors Markdown documents that compile and contain all necessary content without unnecessary content. Authors Markdown documents that employ meaningful formatting to effectively communicate their message. Examples include but are not limited to effective cross-references, interactive elements, bespoke style customizations, accessible metadata, etc. Code Style Git/Github Does not use git for version control. Uses git and github for version control and can contribute to group repositories with commits, pushes, and pulls. Uses git and github effectively. Code commits are of appropriate size and commented well. Can branch and merge repositories while resolving any merge conflicts. Uses Github effectively for collaboration. Can create issues, ask for review, and merge branches in a manner suitable for a professional environment. Smith Grade Criteria Late Work Policy If you do not think you will be able to turn in an assignment by the deadline, you may request an extension. To do so, please send me a message explaining why you are unable to complete the assignment in the expected time frame. Extension requests must be made\u0026ndash;and accepted\u0026ndash;before the assignment due date.\nAfter the due date, late assignments will have their penalty waived only if there were emergency circumstances preventing you from turning the assignment in on time.\nGrade Appeals FAQ This is a test\n"},{"uri":"https://intro-to-data-science-template.github.io/intro_to_data_science_reader/post/2022-06-21-hi-hugo/","title":"Hi Hugo","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Lorem Ipsum.\n"},{"uri":"https://intro-to-data-science-template.github.io/intro_to_data_science_reader/","title":"Intro to Data Science","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Intro to Data Science Quick Links Resource Link Description Syllabus Quick access to all important course information.
