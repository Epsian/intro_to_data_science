Monday and Wednesday classes will include lectures designed to introduce new concepts. Lecture will be followed by interactive problem sets designed to reinforce those concepts through active learning.\nFriday classes will be devoted to larger lab activities or project work time. Students are expected to come to class to work on these activities.\nCourse Policies Required Materials Student Workload Attendance I will not be taking attendance in this course, and you do not need to inform me when you will be absent. If you are sick, please stay home. That said, I expect students to be present when possible. It will be very difficult to keep up with course material without consistent attendance.\nIf you miss a class, you should contact a peer to discuss what was missed, and check the course reader website for any upcoming deadlines. I won\u0026rsquo;t have the capacity this semester to re-deliver missed material in office hours.\nAcademic Honesty Smith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources.\nAny cases of dishonesty or plagiarism will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Examples of dishonesty or plagiarism include:\nSubmitting work completed by another student as your own. Copying and pasting words from sources without quoting and citing the author. Paraphrasing material from another source without citing the author. Failing to cite your sources correctly. Falsifying or misrepresenting information in submitted work. Paying another student or service to complete assignments for you.
