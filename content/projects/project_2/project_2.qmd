## Overview

![](img/open-payments-logo-tm.png "Open Payments program logo")

In 2010, the the Physician Payments Sunshine Act (2010) was passed, requiring medical drug and device manufacturers to disclose payments and other transfers of value made to physicians, non-physician practitioners, and teaching hospitals (known as covered recipients). This law was put into place to promote transparency in our medical system - enabling the U.S. government and citizens to monitor for potential medical conflicts of interest. 

Today, every time a drug or medical device manufacturer makes a payment to a covered recipient, they must disclose the nature of that payment and the amount to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid. Data about payments is then aggregated, reviewed by (and sometimes disputed by) recipients, corrected, and then published as an open government dataset. 

Definitions for what counts as a reporting entity, a covered recipient, and a reportable activity have been expanding since the passing of the Physician Payments Sunshine Act as legislators have raised concerns over the degree of transparency of diversifying financial arrangements in the healthcare system. In 2020, the first settlement for violations to the Sunshine Act was announced, requiring Medtronic Inc. to pay $9.2 million to resolve allegations for failure to report. This served as a signal that enforcement is ramping up in the coming years. In 2022, the state of California passed a law requiring that medical practitioners disclose to patients that this data resource exists.

## Project Description




...but we want to know more than just the ID of a medical practitioner. To identify which doctors are receiving the most money, we also want to know that practitioner's name, location, specialty, etc. Because practitioners' names are manually entered into a database every time a payment is made to them, sometimes the formatting of a practitioner's name entered for one payment can differ from how that same practitioner's name is formatted when entered for another payment. The same goes for other variables related to that practitioner. For instance, check out how the capitalization differs for the practitioner below. In some cases, there is a middle initial, while in others, there is a full middle name; in some cases, the practitioner's name is all capitalized, and in other cases it is not. 

```{r}
#| echo: true

open_payments_dates_cleaned |>
  filter(covered_recipient_npi == 1003040676) |>
  select(covered_recipient_first_name, covered_recipient_middle_name, covered_recipient_last_name)
```




## The Data





## Technical Details

You have 2 weeks (until midnight on 11/25) to work on this project, including two full days of class time (11/11 & 11/21). You have full freedom to make the project as simple or intricate as you desire. Each member of the team must make *at least one* data visualization, table, or comparable presentation of data. Your final submission should include the following:

**In your team Github repo:**

* A Quarto portfolio document (any format) containing:
  + All tables, summaries, and data visualizations you wish to present
  + The code used to generate those items (in your code chunks set *echo* to true)
  + A textual explanation of how you made those items for non-coders
  + A textual explanation of what your summaries/tables/visualization mean
  + A summary explanation of what lessons can be learned from your portfolio as a whole

**Through Moodle ([Turn in here](https://moodle.smith.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=963014)):**

* A word pdf (there is a template in the docs folder) explaining your contributions to the project containing:
  + A 1-2 paragraph summary of how you contributed to your team
  + A list of each standard (per the course syllabus) you *individually* worked with in this project
  + A justification for each standard describing what proficiency level you demonstrated *per the text in the [standards matrix](https://intro-to-data-science-template.github.io/intro_to_data_science_reader/syllabus/#standards)* 

The team portfolio should be created using Quarto in R studio. I recommend you output to a PDF if you have only static visualizations, or html if your visualizations are interactive; you can choose other formats if they work better for your project. You will commit your rendered report in the `docs/` directory of this project.

Each team will share one github repo. This repo should include all of your code. **I recommend creating your visualizations in separate files, and then combining them in your Quarto portfolio document as a separate step.**

## Tips for Success

1. Focus on creating a *minimum viable product* first. This means make something simple that satisfies all of the requirements, then go back and expand on what you have. Don't try to create something ultra-fancy as your first milestone.
2. Start by spending time understanding all of the variables in the provided data. Include a document in your project explaining what all the variables mean.
3. Each person should work in a separate R script for each table/summary/visualization you want to create. Make combining them into your finalized portfolio a separate step.
4. If there is a specific standard you want to raise, look for opportunities to do so. Each part of the data will have different challenges that you can overcome to show your growth.
5. Don't be afraid to branch out! There is no ceiling for this project. If you want to try a new tool or visualization style we haven't covered in class, give it a go. You can explain how you think it shows your proficiency in your Moodle submission.
