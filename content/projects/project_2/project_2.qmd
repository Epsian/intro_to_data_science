## Overview

![](img/open-payments-logo-tm.png "Open Payments program logo")

The [Smith College Museum of Art (SCMA)](https://scma.smith.edu/) staff want to better understand how people use the museum website. Project 1 will focus on real SCMA data spanning from July 2021 to June 2022. Your goal is to create a portfolio of data visualizations which help communicate the usage patterns of the SCMA website to museum staff. You can think of this project as a formalized exploratory data analysis. At the end of Project 1, your visualizations and accompanying reports will be given to the museum staff for them to learn from!

## Project Description







## Technical Details

You have 2 weeks (until start of class !!!) to work on this project, including one full day of class time (!!!). You have full freedom to make the project as simple or intricate as you desire. Each member of the team must make *at least one* data visualization. You can also create tables or other summaries to help explain the data to the reader. Your final submission should include the following:

**In your team Github repo:**

* A Quarto portfolio document (any format) containing:
  + All tables, summaries, and data visualizations you wish to present
  + The code used to generate those items (in your code chunks set *echo* to true)
  + A textual explanation of how you made those items for non-coders
  + A textual explanation of what your summaries/tables/visualization mean
  + A summary explanation of what lessons can be learned from your portfolio as a whole

**Through Moodle ([Turn in here]()):**

* A word pdf (there is a template in the docs folder) explaining your contributions to the project containing:
  + A 1-2 paragraph summary of how you contributed to your team
  + A list of each standard (per the course syllabus) you *individually* worked with in this project
  + A justification for each standard describing what proficiency level you demonstrated *per the text in the [standards matrix](https://intro-to-data-science-template.github.io/intro_to_data_science_reader/syllabus/#standards)* 

The team portfolio should be created using Quarto in R studio. I recommend you output to a PDF if you have only static visualizations, or html if your visualizations are interactive; you can choose other formats if they work better for your project. You will commit your rendered report in the `docs/` directory of this project.

Each team will share one github repo. This repo should include all of your code. **I recommend creating your visualizations in separate files, and then combining them in your Quarto portfolio document as a separate step.**

## Tips for Success

1. Focus on creating a *minimum viable product* first. This means make something simple that satisfies all of the requirements, then go back and expand on what you have. Don't try to create something ultra-fancy as your first milestone.
2. Start by spending time understanding all of the variables in the provided data. Include a document in your project explaining what all the variables mean.
3. Each person should work in a separate R script for each table/summary/visualization you want to create. Make combining them into your finalized portfolio a separate step.
4. If there is a specific standard you want to raise, look for opportunities to do so. Each part of the data will have different challenges that you can overcome to show your growth.
5. Don't be afraid to branch out! There is no ceiling for this project. If you want to try a new tool or visualization style we haven't covered in class, give it a go. You can explain how you think it shows your proficiency in your Moodle submission.
